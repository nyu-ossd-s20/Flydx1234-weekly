## Open Source COVID-19 Projects
  This week, our class had done some research on open efforts regarding COVID-19 and it was amazing to see the huge amount of projects that people have found. One of the projects that I found, was an open source [data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for COVID-19 that was created by the John Hopkin's University. It contained all the information about the total number of cases, deaths, recoveries, and the number of people tested all over the world. Their dashboard that contains all the data updates semi-automatically by pulling data directly from DXY, which is an online platform ran by the chinese medical community that keeps track of case totals of COVID-19. The automation is done every 15 minutes by pulling data fron DXY, and cross referencing it with other sources such as the WHO, and the CDC. This data after being verified, gets added to the dashboard. Many of the open source projects that our class found was similarly data visualization projects such as this one, whether between difference countries, or states. Some of the interesting projects that weren't all about data involved [data prediction](https://predictcovid.com/) to see how the pandemic may progress in the future which may be pretty useful to predict things such as the stock market. Others involved hardware projects such as creating an emergency test kit, or ventilator in a low-cost efficient manner. If anyone is interested in checking the [list we have compiled](https://pad.riseup.net/p/OpenEfforts_COVID19), feel free to do so, and perhaps add more to the list!
